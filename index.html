          <p class="heading-sec__sub">
            Ever since I was a kid, I've loved taking devices apart and putting them back together. That early interest in learning how systems work later evolved into assembling my first desktop computer at the age of 13, and subsequently taking four years of CAD-focused mechanical engineering classes throughout high school. I later pursued a mathematics-heavy major in ecological engineering at Colorado State University for two years, until switching to the broader science of restoration ecology. Despite switching my major, the remainder of my undergraduate curriculum was well-supported by what I learned in my engineering courses, and I graduated in 2016 with a BS in Restoration Ecology.

            As a part of the music scene, I co-founded and served as drummer-producer for the independent prog-punk band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>. Despite the local dominance of folk & americana music, my band achieved substantial success in the Fort Collins scene. Over our five-year run (2016-2021), we played over 70 shows, successfully booked 2 regional tours, and self-produced & released 3 albums. Running an independent music business required the development of many skills in music, audio, video, graphic design, event production, and business management. (See <a href="./index.html#skills">My Skills</a> below for a more specific list.)

My experience within this organization has involved many of the same duties as those of running my band, but with divergent end goals. Guided by our paramount objective of educating the public about animals, I've overseen the production of short-form documentaries, social media content, and recently a new podcast called <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

            Having spent well over a decade pursuing a variety of independent ventures, I've cultivated a diverse & exceedingly valuable perspective on technical project management. This perspective allows me to operate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of audio, film, visual art, and software solutions. In addition to raw technical skills, my time in creative entrepreneurship has lent me a unique awareness of how human & digital systems successfully work together.

            Over the winter of 2022-2023, I attended <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s Software Engineering Program on their Denver campus. During this program, my classmates came to know me as someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable, even electing me as <strong>Most Likely to Help Anyone Anytime</strong> with the course material. The most prominent example of this was my frequent planning of coding walkthroughs & other group learning sessions, which both reinforced my own learning <strong>and</strong> bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts. Having graduated from this program in February of 2023, I look forward to contributing my technical and interpersonal skills to the ever-evolving field of software development.
